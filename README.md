# Project 1 - Onboarding

For this project, I created a website that allows users to register to join a writing/reading club.
The focus of the project was to design for an effortless, engaging entry of personal information; and 
friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or incomplete information. 

Here is a preview of the website in use:
